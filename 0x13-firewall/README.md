# 0x13. Firewall
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Its primary function is to create a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network like the internet.

The firewall inspects all network traffic and examines the data packets to determine whether they should be allowed to pass through or not. It uses a set of predefined rules to determine if a packet should be allowed to pass or not. If a packet meets the criteria set by the rules, it is allowed to pass through the firewall. If it doesn't, it is blocked.

Firewalls can also be configured to perform additional functions, such as content filtering, intrusion detection and prevention, and virtual private network (VPN) support.

There are different types of firewalls, including network firewalls, host-based firewalls, and application firewalls. Network firewalls are the most common type and operate at the network layer of the OSI model, while host-based firewalls operate at the host level and application firewalls operate at the application level.
